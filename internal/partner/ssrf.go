// SSRF protection for outbound webhooks — FR-API-002 | SecD §9.x | MDS §4.22.
//
// A webhook URL is supplied by a third party and fetched by our server from
// inside the private network. That is a server-side request forgery primitive
// unless it is constrained: a partner who registers
// http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ is asking us to read cloud instance
// credentials and POST them somewhere, and one who registers
// https://bss_postgres_primary:5432/ is probing the internal service mesh.
//
// The check runs twice, and the second time is the one that matters.
// Validating only at registration is defeated by DNS rebinding: a hostname
// that resolves publicly when the endpoint is created can resolve to
// 169.254.169.254 by the time a delivery fires. So the dialler re-checks every
// address at connect time, after resolution, where the decision cannot be
// undone by a later DNS answer.

// blockedNets are ranges no legitimate partner endpoint lives in.
