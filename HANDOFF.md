# Handoff — state of play

Rewritten 2026-08-16, after the Phase 4A/4B close-out. The previous version
was written on 2026-08-12 and every number in it had drifted — it claimed 22
migrations against an actual 34, 13/13 wiring against 20/20, and "2 known
lint findings" against 116. Re-derive rather than trust if this file is more
than a few sessions old: `go test ./...`, `check_wiring.sh`, `golangci-lint`
and `git log` are the truth, this file is a convenience.

## Where the project is

The Jaze-parity roadmap (CRD §1.11, adopted as BO-007) is functionally
complete at **98 of 99 FRs**, with FR-AAA-005 deferred by decision — every
other requirement is implemented. The ledger below is reconciled against the
SRS rather than carried forward.

Phases 1–4 are shipped and pushed. The last two commits closed it out:

| Commit | Delivered |
|---|---|
| `33bfd89` | Phase 4A — captive portal (FR-HSP-001), hotspot CoA enforcement (FR-HSP-003), document archival (FR-DOC-001), NAS management API, **RADIUS accounting repair** |
| `1016d7f` | Phase 4B — report export and scheduling (FR-RPT-002), subscriber portal contract parity (FR-MOB-002) |

**Read the accounting repair before trusting any usage number that predates
it.** `subscriber_session_history` was never written: nothing called
`StartSession`/`StopSession`, and the daemon bound only `:1812` while every
NAS sends accounting to `:1813`. FUP enforcement, CoA targeting, LEA lookups
and the portal's usage history were therefore all reading an empty table
while their own tests passed. Any historical usage data from before
`33bfd89` does not exist, and any conclusion drawn from its absence was
wrong for this reason rather than a business one.

### The FR ledger, reconciled 2026-08-16

**98 implemented, 1 deferred (FR-AAA-005), 0 outstanding.**

The SRS contains exactly 99 `FR-*` requirements. Count them with a word
boundary — `grep -oE 'FR-[A-Z]+-[0-9]{3}'` returns 108, because it matches
`FR-AVAIL-001` *inside* `NFR-AVAIL-001`. `grep -oE '\bFR-...'` gives 99, plus
11 genuine NFRs.

Cross-referencing those against every `FR-` citation in Go, SQL and shell —
expanding range notation like `FR-NAS-001..004`, which otherwise matches only
its first id — leaves three unreferenced:

| FR | Status |
|---|---|
| FR-OBS-001 (Prometheus `/metrics`) | Implemented, never cited by id |
| FR-OBS-002 (structured JSON logs, `correlation_id`) | Implemented, never cited by id |
| FR-OBS-005 (alert when RADIUS auth failure rate on any NAS exceeds 20% over 5 min) | Implemented in `internal/radius/authalert.go` |

**FR-AAA-005** (plain CHAP) is the only remaining item, and it is deferred by
decision rather than pending: it requires storing recoverable plaintext
passwords.

FR-OBS-005 needed a new metric before the rule could be expressed at all —
`radius_auth_accept_total` and `radius_auth_reject_total` are unlabelled, so
"on **any NAS**" was not computable from them. `radius_auth_outcome_total`
now carries a `nas` label, and every accept and reject in PAP, EAP and MAB
routes through `authAccepted`/`authRejected` so the labelled and unlabelled
counters cannot drift. Unidentified sources collapse into one `unregistered`
bucket, so a spoofed address cannot mint a series per packet.

Evaluation is in-process because this repository ships no Prometheus and no
Alertmanager; `deploy/prometheus/radius_alerts.yml` carries the same rule in
PromQL, and a test asserts the two thresholds agree. Alerts go to
`logAlerter` — see the open decision below about where they should really go.

Note that FR-AAA-003 was counted complete throughout while being
non-functional until `33bfd89`, so any historical figure overstated reality
by one.

## Current numbers (measured 2026-08-16)

| | |
|---|---|
| Go packages | 35 total; **24 have tests** |
| Wiring check | **22/22** components have a production caller |
| Migrations | 35 applied (`001`–`035`) |
| Browser tests | **45**, all passing (`npx playwright test`, run 2026-08-16) |
| Lint | **6** findings on default tags, **116** with `--build-tags=integration`; none introduced by recent work, all untriaged |
| DB integration suite | ~700s; **must** be run with `-timeout 25m` |
| NFR-PERF-001 (RADIUS auth p99 ≤15ms) | **PASS at 13.224ms**, 5,000 req/s, 30s, 0 errors — `run_nfr_tests.sh`, 2026-08-16 |
| NFR-PERF-002 (API p99 ≤200ms) | **PASS**, 49.01ms at 500 VUs |
| NFR-BIZ-001 (unbilled query ≤60s @20k subs) | **PASS**, 12.2ms |
| NFR-SEC-002 (no plaintext PII) | **PASS** |
| NFR-DUR-002, NFR-SEC-003, NFR-PERF-004 (archival, portal rate-limit, report export) | Merged into the SRS 2026-08-16, all with real code/tests behind them. Report-export threshold (4.5s p99) is set at 2.5× a measured empirical baseline — collection report, worst of the three, ran p99 1.69s over 30 iterations against a seeded 20,000-subscriber/430k-invoice 120-month dataset |

**`run_nfr_tests.sh` and the demo stack cannot run at the same time on this
machine.** The demo stack is 11 containers (Postgres, a 3-node Redis Sentinel
cluster with two replicas, the API, radiusd, the reverse proxy, Gotenberg);
the NFR harness spins up its own isolated set. Sharing this host's 12 CPUs
between both turned a genuine 13ms p99 into a false 20ms failure on
2026-08-16 — the daemon's own histogram showed 99.4% of requests under 15ms
while the client measured a 20ms tail, and the rate sweep was non-monotonic
(1,000 req/s scored worse than 3,000 req/s), both signatures of scheduling
contention rather than slow code. `docker compose stop` before running the
NFR suite, `docker compose start` after.

The lint figure is not a regression — the integration-tagged count has been
that high for some time and simply was never measured before. It is mostly
`noctx` in tests (`httptest.NewRequest` cannot take a context until the
module moves past go1.22). It matters because 116 findings is enough noise
to hide a real one.

A correction to the lint row, and a caution about counting tests by grep. The
previous version's "2 known gosec findings" is now 6 and 116; that is a
measurement, not a regression.

The browser count is 45 and always was. Do not count these with
`grep -c 'test('` — that gives 37, because `staff.spec.ts` generates one test
per role from a matrix loop rather than declaring each. `npx playwright test
--list` is the only count worth quoting. This file briefly claimed 37 for
exactly that reason, which is a small example of the rule at the bottom of
this document: the grep looked authoritative and was wrong, and running it
settled the question in seconds.

## Open decisions that need a person, not a sprint

1. **L6-004 Sentinel failover target.** Measured 5055ms against a 3000ms
   budget; ~3.1s with `down-after-milliseconds` at 500. Recommendation:
   adopt 500 and move the target to 8s. **Separately**, decide whether the
   DNS/tilt failure mode is acceptable — when a master container leaves
   Docker DNS, Sentinel never promotes at all. Reproduce with
   `CHAOS_MODE=kill ./scripts/run_sentinel_failover_test.sh`. See
   `DOD_STATUS_REPORT.md` Finding #6.

2. **The lint backlog needs triage.** 6 findings on default tags, 116 with
   the integration tag. Confirmed not introduced by recent work — the method
   is a `git worktree` at the previous HEAD, lint both, and diff the finding
   sets with line numbers stripped; that is more reliable than `git stash`,
   which re-CRLFs files and creates phantom `gofmt` findings. The ones worth
   a real decision rather than a suppression: G705 in
   `internal/api/invoices.go`, G710 in `internal/staffui/screens.go`, G117 in
   `internal/partner/dispatch.go`, and the missing cookie attributes in
   `internal/tr069/acs.go`.

3. **Alerts have nowhere to go but the log.** `logAlerter` is shared by the
   dead-letter monitor, the SLA scanner and now the per-NAS auth failure
   monitor (FR-OBS-005), and it writes a log line. That satisfies "emit an
   alert" literally, and satisfies nobody at 3am. Deciding the destination —
   Alertmanager, a webhook, the notification service that already sends
   WhatsApp — is a real choice nobody has made, and `staff_users` carries no
   contact details to route to.

4. **`staff_users` has no MFA, no lockout, no password rotation, and no
   account-creation screen** (accounts come from the seed). Migration 021
   added a new authentication surface and none of this was ever specified,
   so these are open decisions rather than omissions.

## Known gaps worth knowing about

- **The archive `Store` interface has no retrieval method.** `Put` and
  `Delete` only — there is currently no code path to read an archived
  document back out and re-verify it. Found 2026-08-16 while writing
  NFR-DUR-002 into the SRS: the checksum is real and verified at write time
  (`archive.LocalStore.Put` hashes while streaming), but "verify on
  retrieval" can't be tested because there is no retrieval. For a compliance
  feature holding 8-year GST invoices and 5-year KYC documents, this matters
  more than it would elsewhere — nobody can currently prove to an auditor
  that a specific archived document is intact without going around the
  application and hashing the file on disk by hand. Adding `Store.Get` and a
  restore/verify path is the natural next slice.
- **`scripts/seed_local.sql` publishes demo credentials.** Bcrypt hashes for
  five staff accounts, with the password named in `TESTERS_MANUAL.md`
  (`staffpassword`). Same category as the existing `testpassword` subscriber
  hashes. Fine for a localhost demo, but this is a public repo — those
  accounts must never exist in a real deployment.
- **The 1-hour soak (L6-005) has never been run.**
  `./scripts/run_soak_test.sh` is committed and validated on a 90s run.
  Needs one uninterrupted hour on a machine that will not sleep.
- **Voucher data caps end the session rather than throttling it.** Not a gap,
  but a decision worth knowing: `hotspot.QuotaScanner` (migration 035)
  disconnects an exhausted voucher instead of dropping it to a slower profile,
  because a voucher is prepaid for a fixed volume and a crawl afterwards reads
  as a broken network rather than a spent voucher. Subscriber-backed hotspot
  grants are deliberately excluded from that scan — they are metered in
  `subscriber_session_history` and throttled by the FUP scanner, and enforcing
  them in both places would disconnect somebody the other path only slowed.
- **The captive portal does not complete MikroTik's own login.** It issues a
  grant and relies on the NAS retrying MAC authentication, which needs
  `login-by=mac` on the hotspot profile and produces the "turn Wi-Fi off and
  on" instruction on the success page. The native flow — POSTing to
  `$(link-login-only)` so the router authenticates immediately — is the
  smoother path and is not built. Also note the walled garden must allow the
  portal host, or a client cannot reach the sign-in page at all.
- **Document archival is local-filesystem only.** The `archive.Store`
  interface is the seam for S3 or SFTP; neither is implemented, and a copy on
  the same machine is not disaster recovery.
- **`ARCHIVE_DIR` unset disables archival and its retention purge** — both
  say so at startup rather than failing silently, but a deployment that skips
  it has no document retention at all.

## Things a fresh session will not know

### Running anything

```bash
./scripts/demo_up.sh                     # full stack; generates .env secrets
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=isp_bss_demo # demo_up.sh hardcodes this
```

Without that variable every `docker compose` command silently targets a
different project and reports containers as not running.

### PostgreSQL HA is opt-in, not the default

The base `docker-compose.yml` runs one Postgres, same as it always has.
The Patroni/etcd HA topology is an overlay:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.pg-ha.yml up -d
```

`demo_up.sh` and the whole test suite run against the single-node stack.
Note that `docker-compose.pg-ha.yml` uses fixed `container_name` values, so
it cannot run side-by-side with the demo stack on one machine without a
name/port override.

### Docker on this machine

- Docker Desktop drops out mid-session. Recover:
  `powershell -Command "Start-Process 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe'"`
  then poll `until docker info; do sleep 3; done`.
- Registry pulls have failed with certificate errors when the host clock
  drifts (the cert reads as not-yet-valid). Cached images still work; do not
  "fix" it by changing the system clock.

### Paths and Docker

`MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` is required for most `docker run` arguments, but it
means POSIX paths reach the Windows Docker binary unconverted. A `/tmp/...`
path becomes `D:\tmp\...` and silently fails. Use `pwd -W` for any `-v` mount
or `-f` file argument. This exact bug produced two sessions' worth of wrong
measurements.

### Line endings

This repo has `core.autocrlf=true`. Any `git stash`/`pop` round-trip
re-CRLFs the files it touches, which makes `gofmt -l` flag entire files as
unformatted even though nothing semantic changed. Fix with
`sed -i 's/\r$//' <file>`; do not change the git config.

### The demo stack keeps serving old code until you rebuild it

`docker compose up -d` reuses the existing image. A stack left running across
a few sessions serves whatever was built when it started, so new routes
answer 404 and a fix appears not to work — which is indistinguishable from
having written it wrong. Check what you are actually talking to:

```bash
docker ps --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'   # "Up 20 hours" is the warning
docker compose build api_service aaa_core_daemon && \
  docker compose up -d api_service aaa_core_daemon
```

Note the API container publishes only `9101` (metrics). Application traffic
goes through the reverse proxy, so probe `https://localhost/...` with
`curl -k`, not `localhost:8080`.

### The demo stack's seeded Redis session expires

`demo_up.sh` seeds `session:active:{id}` with a 24h TTL. A stack left running
longer than that fails the two Playwright tests that check the "online"
dashboard state, for reasons unrelated to whatever you just changed. Reseed
with the same `redis-cli SET ... EX 86400` command from `demo_up.sh`.

This is not hypothetical: it happened again on 2026-08-16. The two failures
are `portal.spec.ts` "live usage" and `staff.spec.ts` "the 360 view". Confirm
it is the seed and not your change before debugging anything —
`redis-cli TTL session:active:1` returning `-2` means the key is gone, and
reseeding makes both tests pass again in seconds.

### `-race` needs a C compiler

`go test -race` requires cgo. In the Git-Bash shell used for recent sessions
`gcc` was not on `PATH`, so those runs were without `-race`. Use a shell
where `gcc` resolves if race detection matters for what you are changing.

---

## Verification that keeps finding real bugs

```bash
gofmt -l internal/ cmd/ && go build ./... && go vet -tags=integration ./...
go test -count=1 ./...                      # 23 packages with tests
bash scripts/run_db_tests.sh -timeout 25m   # ~700s against real PostgreSQL
golangci-lint run --build-tags=integration ./...   # 116 known, none recent
./scripts/check_wiring.sh                   # 20/20 wired
npx playwright test                         # 45 browser tests
```

The DB suite **must** carry `-timeout 25m`. It runs ~700s and Go's 10-minute
default kills it partway, which reads as a hang rather than a timeout.

`check_wiring.sh` exists because three components once shipped complete,
tested, and never called. It is a grep, not a test, and it caught what the
suite could not. It has since caught a fourth: RADIUS accounting persistence
was the canonical case — written, tested, correct, and called by nothing.
When adding a long-running component, add it there too, and prefer tracking
the call that proves it is *mounted* (`handler.RegisterRoutes`) over the one
that proves it was merely constructed.

### The pattern that keeps working

**Run it, don't read it.** Defects that passed code review and failed
execution, across several sessions:

- an endpoint served subscriber IPs unauthenticated while every auth test passed
- the NFR harness reported a 100% error rate that was a daemon which never started
- a TLS test reported a downgrade that never happened
- a Sentinel config override silently never applied
- three components were built, tested, and never wired
- Patroni's bootstrap silently did not create the application database
  (found by running migrations against a real cluster, not by reading docs)
- RADIUS accounting acknowledged every record and stored none, with the
  accounting port unbound, while four features quietly read an empty table
- an accounting dedup test that passed while asserting the *wrong attribute*
  (NAS-Identifier as the session key) — the test and the bug agreed
- a captive-portal anti-oracle test that could not fail, because it compared
  two refusals that shared a MAC
- document retention of `8 * 365 * 24h`, two days short of eight calendar
  years, deleting GST records early in a way nobody would ever notice
- the JWT middleware answering `text/plain` while every handler answered
  JSON, making token expiry the one error a mobile client could not parse

When a check could plausibly pass for the wrong reason, break it
deliberately and confirm it fails. Every negative control run so far has
found something — including two of the entries above, which were *test*
defects found only because the control was run.
