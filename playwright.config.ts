 * These run against a stack already brought up with ./scripts/demo_up.sh —
 * deliberately not via Playwright's `webServer`, which would start and stop the

 * takes minutes and reseeds the database, so owning that lifecycle here would
 * make the suite slow and would silently discard whatever state a tester was
 * looking at.
