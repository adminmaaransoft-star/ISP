# Tester's Manual

How to run the system, sign in as each persona, and exercise the parts that
matter. Every command here was run against the live stack before being written
down.

This file is the command reference. For an illustrated version — every persona's
screens, with screenshots, including the side-by-side contrasts that show what
each role is blocked from — see
`specification_docs_v2/22_PWT_Persona_Walkthrough.md`.

---

## 1. Starting the system

```bash
./scripts/demo_up.sh
```

That brings up PostgreSQL, Redis with three Sentinels and two replicas,
Gotenberg, the RADIUS daemon, the API and the reverse proxy; applies every
migration; generates any missing secrets into `.env`; and seeds demo data.

The portal is then at **`https://localhost/ui/login`**.

Your browser will warn that the connection is not private. That is expected —
the demo issues its own certificate rather than buying a public one. Choose
"Advanced" and continue. Use `curl -k` for the same reason.

To stop: `./scripts/demo_up.sh down` keeps the data, `down -v` wipes it.

### What the seed gives you

| | |
|---|---|
| Subscribers | `test_user` (active), `suspended_user` (hard_suspended) |
| Password | `testpassword` for both |
| Plans | TN_Basic_50M, TN_Super_100M, TN_Ultra_200M |
| Invoices | 1 on `test_user` (₹942.82 = ₹799 + 18% GST) |
| Past sessions | 4, between 67 GB and 512 GB |
| Live session | 1, at 67% of the 3300 GB quota |

Usage sits at 67% deliberately — below the 80% mark that fires a FUP warning,
so testing does not generate notifications nobody asked for.

---

## 2. The six personas

The CRD defines six personas. All six now have a screen: subscribers use the
portal at `/ui`, staff use the operations console at `/staff`.

| ID | Persona | How they reach the system |
|---|---|---|
| PER-001 | ISP Owner | Console at `/staff`, role `isp_owner` |
| PER-002 | NOC Engineer | Console at `/staff`, role `noc_engineer` |
| PER-003 | Billing / Finance Admin | Console at `/staff`, role `billing_admin` |
| PER-004 | CSR | Console at `/staff`, role `csr` |
| PER-005 | Ground Technician | Console at `/staff`, role `technician` |
| PER-006 | End Subscriber | Portal at `/ui` |

The console was not in the original specification — the CRD scopes the web UI
as subscriber self-service and specifies staff needs as APIs. It was added
because driving the JSON API with hand-minted tokens is workable for a load
test and unusable as a day job. Everything it does, the API could already do.

### PER-006 — End Subscriber (the portal)

Browse to `https://localhost/ui/login` and sign in as `test_user` /
`testpassword`. Use `suspended_user` to see how a cut-off customer's account
appears.

Walkthrough: sign in → read the dashboard (balance, plan, status, live usage) →
Usage → Invoices → download a PDF → Renew → file a support ticket → check
Notifications → sign out. Then confirm that typing a portal address while
signed out returns you to the sign-in page.

### PER-001..005 — the operations console

All five staff personas now have a web console at **`https://localhost/staff/login`**.
Seeded accounts, all with password `staffpassword`:

| Username | Persona | Sections |
|---|---|---|
| `owner` | ISP Owner | Subscribers, Billing, Support, Revenue, LEA |
| `noc` | NOC Engineer | Subscribers, LEA |
| `billing` | Billing Admin | Subscribers, Billing |
| `csr` | CSR | Subscribers, Billing, Support |
| `tech` | Ground Technician | Subscribers, Support |

The console issues the same JWT the JSON API validates, so it can never grant
reach the API would refuse. Every handler re-checks the role — hiding a nav
link is a convenience, not a control, and typing the URL directly returns 403.

Worth testing: sign in as `tech`, open a subscriber, and confirm no wallet or
ledger appears; then sign in as `csr` and confirm it does.

### PER-001..005 — the same personas via the API

Mint a token, then call the API with it:

```bash
SECRET=$(grep '^JWT_SECRET=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)

TOKEN=$(go run ./scripts/gen_jwt -secret "$SECRET" -role noc_engineer -ttl 2h)

curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://localhost/api/v1/subscribers/1/health
```

Swap `-role` for the persona you want. Verified behaviour:

| `-role` | subscriber health | subscriber record | wallet ledger |
|---|---|---|---|
| `isp_owner` | 200 | 200 | 200 |
| `noc_engineer` | 200 | 200 | **403** |
| `billing_admin` | 200 | 200 | 200 |
| `csr` | 200 | 200 | 200 |
| `technician` | 200 | 200 | **403** |

**The 403s are correct, not failures.** NOC engineers and ground technicians
have no business reading billing ledgers, and a test that "fixes" them has
broken the authorisation model.

### LCO / franchise partners

```bash
go run ./scripts/gen_jwt -secret "$SECRET" -role franchise_admin -franchise 1
```

The `-franchise` claim scopes rows to that franchise — an LCO must not be able
to see another LCO's subscribers.

### `gen_jwt` flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `-secret` | HMAC signing secret (required) — `JWT_SECRET` from `.env` |
| `-role` | Role claim; default `billing_admin` |
| `-subject` | Subject claim, recorded in audit logs; default `loadtest` |
| `-subscriber` | `subscriber_id` claim, for portal tokens |
| `-franchise` | `franchise_id` claim, for LCO tokens |
| `-lea` | Sets the `lea_access` claim — see below |
| `-ttl` | Token lifetime; default 1h |

---

## 3. Testing LEA lookups

`POST /api/v1/lea/lookup` answers "which subscriber held this IP at this
moment" for a law-enforcement request. It is the most access-sensitive
endpoint in the system and needs **two** independent grants:

1. a role of `noc_engineer` or `isp_owner`, **and**
2. the `lea_access` claim.

They are separate on purpose (SecD §9.3): LEA reach must never arrive as a side
effect of a role assignment made for some other reason. A `noc_engineer` token
without the claim is refused.

```bash
SECRET=$(grep '^JWT_SECRET=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)

# Without the claim — expect 403
NOLEA=$(go run ./scripts/gen_jwt -secret "$SECRET" -role noc_engineer)
curl -sk -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOLEA" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"public_ip":"100.64.0.14","timestamp":"2026-08-09T18:00:00Z"}' \
  https://localhost/api/v1/lea/lookup
# → forbidden: lea_access claim required

# With the claim
LEA=$(go run ./scripts/gen_jwt -secret "$SECRET" -role noc_engineer -lea -subject "insp.rao")
curl -sk -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $LEA" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"public_ip":"100.64.0.14","timestamp":"2026-08-09T18:00:00Z"}' \
  https://localhost/api/v1/lea/lookup
```

A resolving lookup returns the subscriber, their CAF number, mobile number,
registered state and the session that held the address:

```json
{"subscriber_id":1,"caf_number":"CAF-0001","username":"test_user",
 "mobile_number":"+919876543210","registered_state":"TN",
 "session_id":"demo-sess-4","session_start":"2026-08-09T16:03:22Z",
 "session_stop":"2026-08-09T23:03:22Z","source":"direct_ip"}
```

Pass `-subject` something identifying: it is recorded as the accessor.

### Which IPs resolve

The lookup searches **session history**, so the timestamp must fall inside a
session's window. The seeded sessions:

| IP | Window |
|---|---|
| `100.64.0.14` | most recent, ~7 hours, ending yesterday evening |
| `100.64.0.13` | ~2 hours, 3 days ago |
| `100.64.0.12` | ~3 hours, 4 days ago |
| `100.64.0.11` | ~9 hours, 6 days ago |

Get the exact windows with:

```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres_primary psql -U postgres -d isp_bss_oss \
  -c "SELECT assigned_ipv4, start_time, stop_time FROM subscriber_session_history ORDER BY start_time DESC;"
```

`100.64.0.7` is the *live* session, which is held in Redis and not yet in
history, so it returns 404. That is correct behaviour, not a bug.

### Verifying the audit trail

Every lookup is recorded **whether or not it found anything** — an attempted
query is as auditable as a successful one:

```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres_primary psql -U postgres -d isp_bss_oss \
  -c "SELECT id, accessor_identity, accessor_role, queried_public_ip,
             result_row_count, accessed_at FROM lea_audit_log ORDER BY id;"
```

A miss records `result_row_count = 0`; a hit records the subscriber id.

The table is append-only at the database level — the application's role is
neither its owner nor a superuser, so Row-Level Security genuinely applies and
an `UPDATE` is rejected rather than silently permitted. Worth testing directly
if you are validating the compliance story.

## 4. Known gaps

| Gap | Status |
|---|---|
| Renewal payments | **Blocked** — needs `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` / `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`. The screen works; the payment round trip cannot complete. Report as blocked, not failed. |
| Archived document retrieval | **Not built.** `archive.Store` has `Put` and `Delete` but no read path, so an archived invoice cannot be fetched back and re-verified through the application. |
| Sentinel failover | ~5.1s on the shipped config against a 3s budget. See `DOD_STATUS_REPORT.md` finding 6. |

---

## 5. Automated browser tests

The Go suite covers handlers but never renders anything. The Playwright suite
covers the half that only exists in a browser: that the template produced
readable markup, that the form posts what the handler expects, that the session
cookie survives navigation, and that HTMX swapped a fragment in rather than
replacing the page.

```bash
./scripts/demo_up.sh          # the suite runs against a stack already up
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

15 tests, about 23 seconds. `npm run test:e2e:headed` watches it drive a real
browser; `npm run test:e2e:report` opens the HTML report after a run.

| Area | Covered |
|---|---|
| Authentication | Form renders, valid sign-in, wrong password, all six pages redirect when signed out, logout ends the session |
| Dashboard | Plan, balance, status and live usage figures; navigation to every section |
| Invoices | List with amounts, PDF download verified by magic bytes, another subscriber's invoice refused |
| Tickets | Submission appears via HTMX swap, missing CSRF token refused, wrong CSRF token refused |
| Renewal | Form renders and degrades readably when the gateway is unconfigured |

The suite runs against a stack you started, not one it starts itself — bringing
up PostgreSQL, three Sentinels, RADIUS and the API takes minutes and reseeds
the database, so owning that lifecycle would make the suite slow and would
discard whatever state you were looking at.

Two things it asserts that a weaker test would miss: the PDF check reads the
`%PDF-` magic bytes rather than the status code, because a 200 carrying an HTML
error page would satisfy a status assertion; and the wrong-password test
asserts the page does **not** say which field was wrong, since naming it would
turn the login form into an account enumerator.

## 6. Reporting findings

Three things make a report actionable: **which page or endpoint**, **what you
did**, and **what you saw instead of what this manual says to expect**. A
screenshot of the whole browser window, address bar included, usually answers
all three.

Mark anything involving payment as *blocked* rather than failed, so the same
known gap does not get raised repeatedly and bury real findings.
